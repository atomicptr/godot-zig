# godot-zig

This repository contains Zig bindings for the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot)'s GDNative API.

**This project is a work in progress and you probably shouldn't use it.**

## Engine compatibility

Currently only Godot 3.4 is officially supported. You can probably get other 3.x versions working by switching
the tag of godot-headers and re-generating the bindings.

## Usage
